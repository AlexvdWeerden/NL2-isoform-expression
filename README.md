# NL2 Differential Isoform Expression 

Contained within this GitHub repository is the code used during the Honours project: Investigating Neuronal Expression and Function of LncRNA NL2, for the partial completion of the degree of BSc(Hons) in Genetics at the University of Otago. 

The code is split into folders based on the programming language used and the function of the code. The code is in html files. The quality report following bioinformatic analysis, generated using MultiQC, is included.

Included is the SignalsImageArtist detailed protocols for image analysis.

Included are the full differential gene and variant differential expression results in Supplementary Table 6-9.

Included is the raw Cp values gained from qPCR, in Supplementary Table 10.
